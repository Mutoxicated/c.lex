A general-purpose programming language, with the goal of lending the user unique freedom through setting rules to the compiler, improving code organization and maintainability.

The proof of concept:
```
let global a be 1

let b be "this is a string"

let function name(int integer) -> bool be:
  if integer > 0:
    return true
  return false

let c be name
```
